This  ROS node will read messages published to the /imu/data and /imu/mag topics in order to perform the magnetometer calibration.

* To run the calibration process:

       roslaunch calibrate_imu calibrator.launch 

* To start collecting samples from the IMU:

       rosservice call /start_sampling

* To calibrate the magnetometer using the current data samples:

       rosservice call /calibrate_mag

This will store the calibration parameters in a file called "mag_calibration_d_m_y_H_M_S", where d_m_y_H_M_S is the time the file was created.  For an example on how to read the file you can look at the plot_calibration_data.py script

* To visualize the raw data from the magnetometer and the calibrated data:

       python plot_calibration_data.py ../data/mag_calibration_d_m_y_H_M_S
